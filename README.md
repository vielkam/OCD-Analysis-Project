<h1>Analysing the Relationship between Family History and Obsessions/Compulsions Severity in OCD Patients</h1>


# <h2>Description</h2>
In this project I analyse the relationship between OCD severity and family history. OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) is a chronic condition characterised by intrusive thoughts and fears, followed by obsessions (or "rituals") to ease those thoughts/fears. This condition can consume a lot of a person's time and, if left untreated, can become paralysing. As someone who is grealty interested in the Health Sciences, I wanted to explore whether there was a significant relationship between a person's OCD severity, and family history of OCD.
