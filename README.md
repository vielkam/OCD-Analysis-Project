<h1>Analysing the Relationship between Family History and Obsessions/Compulsions Severity in OCD Patients</h1>


# <h2>Description</h2>
In this project I analyse the relationship between OCD severity and family history. OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) is a chronic condition characterised by intrusive thoughts and fears, followed by obsessions (or "rituals") to ease those thoughts/fears. This condition can consume a lot of a person's time and, if left untreated, can become paralysing. As someone who is grealty interested in the Health Sciences, I wanted to explore whether there was a significant relationship between a person's OCD severity, and family history of OCD.

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

The dataset used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle: OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics and Clinical Data https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ohinhaque/ocd-patient-dataset-demographics-and-clinical-data
This dataset includes information about patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, including patient ID, age, gender, family history of OCD, previous diagnoses, among others. The goal was to analyse the relationships (if any) between these variables and the severity of OCD.
